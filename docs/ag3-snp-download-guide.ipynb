    "\n",
    "This notebook provides information about how to download data from the [Ag1000G phase 3 SNP data release](https://www.malariagen.net/data/ag1000g-phase3-snp). This includes sample metadata, raw sequence reads, sequence read alignments, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions about this guide or how to use the data, please [start a new discussion](https://github.com/malariagen/vector-public-data/discussions/new) on the malariagen/vector-public-data repo on GitHub. If you find any bugs, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/malariagen/vector-public-data/issues/new/choose).\n",

    "\n",
    "This guide is written as a Jupyter notebook. Code examples that are intended to be run via a Linux command line are prefixed with an exclamation mark (!). If you are running these commands directly from a terminal, remove the exclamation mark.\n",

    "Data in this release are hosted by several different services. \n",

    "Raw sequence reads in FASTQ format, sequence read alignments in BAM format, and SNP calls in VCF format are hosted by the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). This guide provides examples of downloading data from ENA via FTP using the `wget` command line tool, but please note that there are several other options for downloading data, see the [ENA documentation on how to download data files](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/retrieval/file-download.html) for more information.  \n",

All data hosted in GCS are publicly accessible and do not require any authentication to access. This guide provides examples of downloading data from GCS to a local computer using the `gsutil` command line tool. For more information about `gsutil`, see the [gsutil tool documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)."
