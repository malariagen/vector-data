    "\n",
    "**7 January 2021**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides information about how to download data from the [MalariaGEN Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes project (Ag1000G) phase 3 SNP data release](https://www.malariagen.net/data/ag1000g-phase3-snp). This includes sample metadata, raw sequence reads, sequence read alignments, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions about this guide or how to use the data, please [start a new discussion](https://github.com/malariagen/vector-public-data/discussions/new) on the malariagen/vector-public-data repo on GitHub. If you find any bugs, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/malariagen/vector-public-data/issues/new/choose).\n",

    "## About this guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is written as a Jupyter notebook. Code examples that are intended to be run via a Linux command line are prefixed with an exclamation mark (!). If you are running these commands directly from a terminal, remove the exclamation mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples in this guide assume you are downloading data to a local folder within your home directory at the path `~/vo_agam_release/`. Change this if you want to download to a different folder on the local file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data hosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in this release are hosted by several different services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Raw sequence reads in FASTQ format, sequence read alignments in BAM format, and SNP calls in VCF format are hosted by the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). This guide provides examples of downloading data from ENA via FTP using the `wget` command line tool, but please note that there are several other options for downloading data, see the [ENA documentation on how to download data files](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/retrieval/file-download.html) for more information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sample metadata in CSV format and SNP calls in Zarr format are hosted on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) in the `vo_agam_release` bucket, which is a multi-region bucket located in the United States. All data hosted on GCS are publicly accessible and do not require any authentication to access. This guide provides examples of downloading data from GCS to a local computer using the `gsutil` command line tool. For more information about `gsutil`, see the [gsutil tool documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)."
