    "The [*Anopheles gambiae* 1000 Genomes Project (Ag1000G)](https://www.malariagen.net/ag1000g) is a collaborative project using whole-genome sequencing to study genetic variation and evolution in natural populations of mosquitoes in the *Anopheles gambiae* species complex. \n",

We hope the data from Ag3 will be a valuable resource for research and surveillance of malaria vectors.
