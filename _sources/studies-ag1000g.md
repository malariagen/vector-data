# Ag1000G partner studies

The Ag1000G project is coordinated by a consortium of partners from a range of different research institutions and countries.
This includes consortium members who are carrying out independent research studies in malaria endemic regions, and who have contributed mosquito specimens or mosquito DNA samples collected in the course of their own research.
This page describes the studies that have contributed samples to the Ag1000G project, which includes wild-caught samples from 19 African countries.
This page also provides information about the collection locations and methods, the people involved in the studies, and references to any published articles providing further information about the studies.

Throughout this page we use species nomenclature following {cite}`Coetzee2013`.
Unless otherwise stated, the DNA extraction method used for the collections described below was Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Science, MD, USA).

### Study information

These samples were collected as part of a study which took place in Cameroon in Central Africa.
The country is commonly referred to as "miniature Africa", owing to the diversity of its climate, topography, landscape, and bio-ecological settings: arid savannas in the north gradually turn into rain forest in the south, along with highland areas, contribute to increase diversity of ecological settings.
Anopheline mosquitoes were collected in 2005 from 64 locations covering a 1,500 km north-to-south transect that crossed all eco-geographical areas of Cameroon {cite}`Simard2009`.
Mosquito collection involved spraying aerosols of pyrethroid insecticides inside human dwellings, dead mosquitoes were retrieved from white sheets that were laid on the floor.
Anopheline mosquitoes were identified using morphological identification keys {cite}`Gillies1968,Gillies1987`.
Ovaries from half-gravid {{ gamb }} s.l. females were dissected and stored in Carnoy's fixative solution (absolute ethanol:glacial acetic acid 3:1) for cytogenetic analyses.
Carcasses were stored individually in tubes containing a desiccant and kept at -20C until they were processed for molecular analysis.
All half-gravid specimens collected in each village were identified to species and molecular forms using PCR-RFLP {cite}`Fanello2002`.

### Study information

Collections were made from four different study sites around the border between Guinea and Mali.
From Mali; Takan (11.47, -8.33) and Toumani Oulena (10.83, -7.81) are both small villages in the Yanfolila district of southern Mali and represent the Sudanian savannah ecological zone.
Takan is arid savannah, while Toumani Oulena is humid savannah.
In Guinea Conakry, mosquitoes were sampled from Koraboh (9.28, -10.03), a small village in the Kissidougou district in the Faranah region representing a semi-forest site with intermediate ecology, a mix of savannah and forest, and in Koundara (8.48, -9.53), a small village in the Macenta district in the Nzerekore region representing deep forest ecology. 
All reported collections occurred in October and November 2012.
At each site, mosquitoes were collected using three different methods: human-landing capture, indoor manual aspirator or pyrethroid spray catch, and larval capture - where the first and second instar larvae were raised to adult in a field insectary under standard insectary conditions prior to DNA isolation from the adults, and the third and fourth instar larvae were preserved directly for DNA isolation, without rearing in the insectary.
The two distinct methods of larval collection were used to control for possible genetic bias inherent in lab rearing of captured larvae.
Across sites, all types of larval sites were sampled, including both temporary and permanent sites.
Human-landing captures were performed both inside dwellings and outside ({math}`>10`m from dwelling) at night between 18:00 and 06:30.
The indoor aspirator or spray catches were done in the morning between 06:00 and 12:00.
Adult specimens or third and fourth instar larvae were preserved immediately in 80% ethanol until later DNA extraction.
First and second instar larvae were raised to adults in nearby field insectaries and upon emergence were preserved in 80% ethanol.
DNA was extracted from mosquitoes using DNAzol by the provided protocol (Invitrogen, CA, USA).

### Study information

Tanzanian samples were collected from four distinct locations.
Moshi samples came from lower Mabogini (-3.400, 37.350), rice fields near lower Moshi on the southern slope of Mount Kilimanjaro, a region shown to have increasing resistance to pyrethroids {cite}`Matowo2014`.
Mosquitoes were collected as larvae, during the rice growing season in August-September 2012, raised to adults and females bioassayed in WHO tubes for one hour with 0.05% lambda cyhalothrin.
Alive and dead mosquitoes were preserved over silica.
In Tanzanian samples screened in Kabula et al. {cite}`Kabula2012`, Moshi was the most pyrethroid resistant population, they were found to be completely DDT susceptible, only in one out of 642 mosquitoes assayed by {cite}`Matowo2014` was found to carry a *kdr* resistance mutation (Vgsc-995F).

Tarime collections took place in the village of Komaswa (-1.417, 34.183) about 410 km north west of Moshi, during August 2012.
Mosquito larvae were collected, raised to adults and females bioassayed with a range of insecticides in WHO tubes for one hour finding almost complete multi-insecticide susceptibility: permethrin (100% mortality), lambda cyhalothrin (97%), fenitrothion (100%), DDT (100%) and bendiocarb (100%) {cite}`Matiya2019`.

Muheza samples were collected from Zeneti village (-5.217, 38.650), northeast Tanzania.
Malaria is intense and perennial with transmission peaking after the rainy season in May and June {cite}`Kabula2012`.
Mosquitoes were sampled between November 2012 and May 2013.
Indoor resting collections were used to obtain live females for deltamethrin susceptibility testing and pyrethrum spray catches were used for mosquitoes that were collected for blood meal analysis.
Collections were conducted between 06:00 and 09:00 from randomly selected houses.
Live mosquitoes collected for susceptibility testing were provided with 10% glucose solution and transported to the field insectary.
Mosquitoes were sorted and morphologically identified to species, carcasses were stored individually over desiccant for laboratory processing.

Muleba (1.750, 31.667), the final collection region, is in the North-western part of Tanzania.
The district is known to be a malaria epidemic prone area with unstable transmission of varying seasonality.
The highest peak of malaria transmission is usually reached between May-July and November-January, which results from proceeding rain seasons.
There have been malaria vector control efforts since 2007 when indoor residual spraying using lambda cyhalothrin was introduced.
Insecticide resistance in this district is coupled with high frequency of *kdr* pyrethroid target site mutations in the {{ gamb }} s.s. population ({cite}`Kabula2012`, {cite}`Protopopoff2013`).
Sampling was conducted over six months, which include both dry and rainy season and covers 6 villages selected to represent all major ecological systems in the district.

### Study information

Indoor resting female mosquitoes were collected by pyrethrum spray catch from four hamlets around Njabakunda (13.55, -15.90), North Bank Region, The Gambia between August and October 2011.
The four hamlets were Maria Samba Nyado, Sare Illo Buya, Kerr Birom Kardo, and Kerr Sama Kuma; all are within 1 km of each other.
This is an area of unusually high hybridization rates between {{ gamb }} s.s. and {{ colu }} {cite}`Caputo2008,Nwakanma2013`.
Njabakunda village is approximately 30km to the west of Farafenni town and 4km away from the Gambia River. 
The vegetation is a mix of open savannah woodland and farmland. 
With apparent high gene-flow in the region, it is problematic to assign species to these samples.

### Study information

Specimens were collected along the Gambia River from the western coastal region of The Gambia {cite}`Caputo2008`, in August 2006. 
{{ gamb }} and {{ colu }} specimens were identified to species following the PCR-RFLP protocol {cite}`Fanello2002` using DNA extracted from the mosquito leg.
Only {{ colu }} specimens were collected from villages of Tankular (13.417, -16.033) and Kalataba (13.550, -15.617). 
{{ gamb }} and {{ colu }} specimens were found in sympatry and collected from villages of Yallal Tankonjala (13.550, -15.700), Sare Samba Sowe (13.583, -15.900) and Hamdalai (13.567, -16.0167).
PCR-RFLP protocol also revealed the presence of mosquitoes with hybrid {{ gamb }}/{{ colu }} genotype in Yallal Tankonjala and Sare Samba Sowe.
Collections of indoor daytime-resting half gravid mosquitoes were carried out mainly in human dwellings and, in few cases, in animal shelters.
Collections were carried out by pyrethroid and/or paper-cup mouth aspirators from 12 AM to sunset, and kept in vials with desiccant.
Ovaries were dissected, maintained into Carnoy fixative (three parts pure ethanol:one part glacial acetic acid) and stored at -20C before polytene chromosome preparations {cite}`Caputo2008`
Chromosome scoring was carried out under a phase‐contrast optical microscope. 
Paracentric inversion karyotypes were scored according to the nomenclature and conventions of {cite}`Coluzzi1979` and {cite}`Toure1998`.

### Study information

Specimens were obtained from two locations in Uganda: Nagongera, 30km to the North of Lake Victoria near the border with Kenya, and Kihihi, in the very South-West of the country.
In Nagongera, Tororo District (0.77, 34.026), mosquitoes were collected by CDC light trap, resting and window trap collections, during October 2012.
This is an area of intense perennial malaria transmission {cite}`Kilama2014`.
Additional details of vector population bionomics may be found in {cite}`Okello2006, Ramphul2009, Mawejje2013, Weetman2014`.
Specimens were stored in 80% ethanol and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen plate protocol. 
In Kihihi subcounty, Kanungu District (-0.751, 29.701), resting mosquitoes were collected during October and November 2012.
Kihihi is located in an  upland area with seasonal malaria transmission {cite}`Kilama2014`.
Specimens were stored in 80% ethanol and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen plate protocol.
All specimens from both collections were {{ gamb }} {cite}`Fanello2002`.

### Study information

15 crosses were contributed to Ag1000G phase 3, 11 of which were previously released in Ag1000G phase 2.
Crosses were generated using parents from eight different colonies: G3 (MRA-112); Kisumu (MRA-762); Pimperena (canonical representative of {{ gamb }} species; MRA-861); Ghana (recent colony of {{ colu }} from Okyereko, southern Ghana {cite}`Edi2014`; Mali-NIH (canonical representative of {{ colu }} species; Niono, MRA-860); (P)Akron (Benin, MRA-913); Nagongera (Tororo, Uganda); and Tiassalé (southern Côte d’Ivoire {cite}`Edi2014`.
The cross family labels, e.g. "29-2", are identifiers used for each of the crosses within the contributor project and have no special meaning.


*Anopheles gambiae* is a swarm-mater and crosses were therefore undertaken in mixed groups involving 4-10 females from a single colony with 1-4 males from each from a different colony in plastic cups covered with netting with 10% sugar water provided ad libitum. 
Females were fed on human blood. After 3 days, males were removed and individually preserved in 95% ethanol. 
Gravid or half-gravid females were then removed and placed in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes.
Females that did not appear gravid were given a second blood meal before placing in Eppendorf tubes for egg laying. 
Following egg deposition, females were removed and stored in tubes containing ethanol for subsequent DNA extraction.
Eggs were floated in clear plastic trays (15x10x5cm) and, following hatching, larvae were raised on finely-ground fish food (Tetramin).
Trays were checked daily and pupae were placed individually into small, labelled centrifuge tubes.
Offspring were removed on eclosion and stored in individual tubes containing ethanol.
DNA was extracted from parents and offspring using the Qiagen DNeasy kit.


A preliminary assessment of the father of each cross was obtained by genotyping seven microsatellite loci in the mother, potential fathers and five or six offspring.
Where possible, the colony of origin of each father was established using individual clustering of the mothers and fathers in BAPS version 5.2, with cluster identity mapped to colony of origin via the mothers (for which the colony was known).
The four crosses that are novel to phase 3: B5, K2, K4 and K6, required further analysis to ascertain the true father of each cross, given mother and offspring.
For each cross for which the father was in doubt, the list of potential parental pairs was determined. 
For each of these pairs Mendelian error was computed for every sample of the progeny and the median value (among samples) was plotted.
In these four crosses (B5, K2, K4 and K6) one pair yielded median Mendelian errors significantly lower for every autosome than all other pairs, identifying the parsimonious parents.
Two of the novel crosses, K4 and K6, were found to be fathered by the same male, `AC0398`.
